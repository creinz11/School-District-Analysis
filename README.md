# School-District-Analysis
Overview: The purpose of this analysis was to help our client conduct a review of Math and Reading performance accross a variety of schools in the administration's purview. Ths analysis considered several factors ranging from budget, spending per pupil, and charter vs. public schools. The goal of this analysis was to provide administration with key data points in order to better plan and allocate funds in subsequent years. In addition to this analysis, the administration notices some academic impropriety in a particular school (Thomas High School, or THS). As a result, we were asked to remove all 9th grade Math and Reading scores from this particular school. This resulted in the omission of 461 records.

## Results

In light of the omission of records from Thomas High School, we have provided the below summary to document the impact relative to out analysis:

1) Impact on district summary: The district saw a modest decrease in Math, Reading, and Overall Passing rates with the omission of the erroneous THS 9th grade date. The Math Passing Rate declined from 74.9% to 73.9%, Reading Passing Rate declined from 85.8% to 84.7%, and the Overall Passing Rate declined from 65.2 to 64.1%

2) Impact on Thomas High School: The impact to THS' aggregate scoring was relatively subtle with the omission; Math Passing declined form 93.3% to 93.1%, Reading declined from 97.3% to 97.0%, and Overall Passing declined from 90.9% to 60.6% respectively.

3) THS' Performance in comparison to their peers: Despite the omission of data, THS is still a high-performaing school by comparison to the rest of the district. Even after our revised analysis, THS found itself in the top five of schools based on their overall passing rate. 

4) Impact on scores by grade: Since the only data omitted from our analysis was from 9th grade, the impact to our scores by grade analysis was limited. THS still performed well relative to the rest of the district.

5) Scores by school spending: THS falls into the second highest category for per-capita spending ($638 per pupil). In removing the 9th grade data, we saw a marginal decline in passing rates accross the board. I'm intentionally including the unformatted version of both tables to highlight how de minimis the change was:

6) Scores by school size: THS falls into the "Medium" Size of schools. We saw a similar insiginifcant impact with the omission of 9th grade data

7) Scores by school type: THS is a Charter school. See below for comparative rates for our original analysis and revised analysis. Again, I am intentially including the unformatted version to highlight the deminimis impact on passing rates.

## Significant Changes Arising From our Revised Analysis
Despite the omission of 9th grade statistics, the school continued to perform well against their peer group on a relative basis. The Largest impact is the reduction of 461 student records, which imapcted THS' individual passing statistics for Math, Reading and overall. The impacts on the overall district wide statics were de minimis, ultimately only resulting in changes of a few basis points. While the academic impropriety is troubeling and may be symptomatic of a wider culture issue at THS, the school still performs very well as compared to the wider district.
