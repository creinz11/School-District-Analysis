# School-District-Analysis
Overview: The purpose of this analysis was to help our client conduct a review of Math and Reading performance accross a variety of schools in the administration's purview. Ths analysis considered several factors ranging from budget, spending per pupil, and charter vs. public schools. The goal of this analysis was to provide administration with key data points in order to better plan and allocate funds in subsequent years. In addition to this analysis, the administration notices some academic impropriety in a particular school (Thomas High School, or THS). As a result, we were asked to remove all 9th grade Math and Reading scores from this particular school. This resulted in the omission of 461 records.

## Results

In light of the omission of records from Thomas High School, we have provided the below summary to document the impact relative to out analysis:

1) Impact on district summary: The district saw a modest decrease in Math, Reading, and Overall Passing rates with the omission of the erroneous THS 9th grade date. The Math Passing Rate declined from 74.9% to 73.9%, Reading Passing Rate declined from 85.8% to 84.7%, and the Overall Passing Rate declined from 65.2 to 64.1%

2) Impact on Thomas High School: The impact to THS' aggregate scoring was relatively subtle with the omission; Math Passing declined form 93.3% to 93.1%, Reading declined from 97.3% to 97.0%, and Overall Passing declined from 90.9% to 60.6% respectively.

3) THS' Performance in comparison to their peers: Despite the omission of data, THS is still a high-performaing school by comparison to the rest of the district. Even after our revised analysis, THS found itself in the top five of schools based on their overall passing rate. 

4) Impact on scores by grade: Since the only data omitted from our analysis was from 9th grade, the impact to our scores by grade analysis was limited. THS still performed well relative to the rest of the district.

5) Scores by school spending:

6) Scores by school size:

7) scores by school type:


Summary: Summarize four major changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
